Console Substitute
------
Most schools have blocked the javascript console on their chromebooks, so as a substitute, you can copy this into your html website:

In the head:

```html
  <script src="utilities.glitch.me/console.js"></script>
```

And wherever you wish to have your substitute console:
```html
<div id="console-utility"></div>
```

And you're done!
